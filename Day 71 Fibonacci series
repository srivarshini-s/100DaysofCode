Write a program to find the nth term in the Fibonacci series using recursion. Note that the first 2 terms in the Fibonacci Series are 0 and 1.

Input Format

Input consists of an integer.

Output Format

The output consists of an integer(nth term of the Fibonacci series).



Sample Input 1

5

Sample Output 1

The term 5 in the Fibonacci series is 3

CODE:

import java.util.*;
class Main {
	static int fib(int n)
    {
	if(n==1 || n==2)
			return n-1;
		return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
	}

	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
      int n=s.nextInt();
		System.out.println("The term "+n+" in the Fibonacci series is "+fib(n));
	}
}
